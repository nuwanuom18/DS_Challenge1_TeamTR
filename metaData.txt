RF (radio-frequency) readings and magnetic readings of moving vehicles were captured (the visual representation .pdf shows the setup for data collection)
The recording device was programmed to capture 10,000 RF samples and 2 magnetic samples (a three axis magnetometer was used, therefore each magnetic sample contains 3 values, x, y, and z) per record.
The raw RF and magnetic data has been processed and added into the dat csv files.
Fast furior transform (FFT) has been applied to the RF data.
Magnetic data has been converted into magnitude and angles.
